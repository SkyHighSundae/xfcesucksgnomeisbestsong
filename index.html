    <h1>Shitty XFCE Sucks and GNOME is Best</h1>
    <p>(Verse 1)<br>
    I boot my machine, and what do I see?<br>
    XFCE staring back at me, oh gee,<br>
    Clunky icons, outdated feel,<br>
    A desktop that just doesn't appeal.</p>

    <p class="chorus">Shitty XFCE sucks, it's such a mess,<br>
    When it comes to desktops, GNOME is the best,<br>
    Sleek and smooth, with style and grace,<br>
    GNOME takes the crown, wins the race.</p>

    <p>(Verse 2)<br>
    XFCE's light, but it's so bare,<br>
    Customizing it, I pull out my hair,<br>
    Themes are scarce, settings too,<br>
    Why can't it just work, like GNOME do?</p>

    <p class="chorus">Shitty XFCE sucks, it's such a mess,<br>
    When it comes to desktops, GNOME is the best,<br>
    Sleek and smooth, with style and grace,<br>
    GNOME takes the crown, wins the race.</p>

    <p>(Bridge)<br>
    GNOME's got extensions, make it your own,<br>
    Polished and modern, never alone,<br>
    Activities overview, it's all so clear,<br>
    With GNOME by my side, I've got nothing to fear.</p>

    <p>(Verse 3)<br>
    XFCE, you're stuck in the past,<br>
    Your outdated charm just won't last,<br>
    GNOMEâ€™s got the future, it's plain to see,<br>
    A desktop environment that's right for me.</p>

    <p class="chorus">Shitty XFCE sucks, it's such a mess,<br>
    When it comes to desktops, GNOME is the best,<br>
    Sleek and smooth, with style and grace,<br>
    GNOME takes the crown, wins the race.</p>

    <p>(Outro)<br>
    So I'll wave goodbye to XFCE,<br>
    And welcome GNOME, so fancy and free,<br>
    A desktop that's perfect, nothing less,<br>
    Yeah, GNOME is the best, it truly impresses.</p>
